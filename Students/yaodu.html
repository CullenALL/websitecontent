								I am a bilingual Mandarin-English speech language pathologist (SLP) who is pursuing a PhD in Informatics (Fall 2016-Present) at University of California, Irvine. I am currently working on mobile health applications under supervision of my advisor Dr. Gillian Hayes. I have worked with both pediatric and geriatric population from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds in diverse settings such as schools, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and outpatient clinics. I interested in 1) understanding how individuals with disabilities may benefit from assistive technology to facilitate their therapy outcomes, and 2) how can health professionals utilize health information technology to improve their clinical workflow, shared clinical decision support, and interactive communication to support continuity of care of their patients.

								Currently, my research focuses on designing mobile health applications for screening receptive language delays among young children (age 2-4) and aging seniors (age 65+). I plan to use both qualitative research methods (e.g., interviews, surveys, observations, and focus groups) and quantitative research methods to design experimental studies for both of my projects.
